  # Hi, I'm Isabella Namutenda        
  # Full-stack Web Developer     
I'm passionate about software development and engineering. I believe in making change through software development and helping people move from the old way of life to the new way of life. My interests are in front-end development and back-end development. 
My stacks include HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, jQuery React, Redux, JavaScript, Ruby, and Ruby on Rails.
